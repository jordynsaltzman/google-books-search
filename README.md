## Description

This assignment required us to create React components, work with helper/util functions, and utilize React lifecycle methods to query and display books based on user searches. I also used Node, Express and MongoDB so that users can save books to review or purchase later. This is a SPA (Single Page Application) that uses react-router-dom to navigate, hide and show React components without changing the route within Express.

On the "Search" page, the user can search for books via the Google Books API, which will render on the page. The user has the option to "View" a book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Save" a book, saving it to the Mongo database.

The "Saved" page renders all books saved to the Mongo database. The user has an option to "View" the book, bringing them to the book on Google Books, or "Delete" a book, removing it from the Mongo database.

For the UI, I used a muted "library-esque" color palatte and created a responsive layout with Bootstrap.
